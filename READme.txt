The files in this directory contain the code we used along with some of the csv files we created through those codes. I wanted to include them since "2_generate_product_metrics.py" and "10_train_and_predict.py" take long time to finish. customer_product_metrics.csv and submission.csv are included for that reason. I did not use relative paths because of a problem in my vscode the path are all paths of my computer. The 'csv_project' folder includes all the CSV files we've used, as well as the ones we've generated, again to prevent any loss. The code files should run sequentially from 1 to 10, as indicated in the presentation. We'll likely only cover up to code 9 during the demo, and demonstrate code 10 using the samples to save time. I wanted to explain the structure in case of a misunderstanding.
